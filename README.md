## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** labs. 

These labs cover fundamental concepts in computer systems including data representation, assembly programming, memory hierarchies, exceptional control flow, virtual memory, and concurrent programming.

## Project Description

### Data Lab
Implements simple logical, two's complement, and floating point functions using a highly restricted subset of C. This lab helps understand the bit-level representations of C data types and the bit-level behavior of operations on data.

### Bomb Lab
A reverse engineering challenge where a "binary bomb" must be defused by determining 6 correct input strings through disassembly and program analysis. The lab teaches assembly language understanding and debugger usage.

### Attack Lab
Explores buffer overflow vulnerabilities in x86-64 binaries through code injection and return-oriented programming attacks. Students learn about stack discipline and dangers of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### Architecture Lab
Students optimize a Y86-64 array copying function and a pipelined processor design to minimize clock cycles per array element, gaining appreciation for hardware-software interactions.

### Cache Lab
Involves writing a general-purpose cache simulator and optimizing a matrix transpose kernel to minimize cache misses. Uses the Valgrind tool to generate address traces.

### Performance Lab
Focuses on optimizing application kernel functions like convolution or matrix transposition, demonstrating cache memory properties and low-level program optimization techniques.

### Shell Lab
Implementation of a simple Unix shell with job control features, including ctrl-c and ctrl-z handling, fg, bg, and jobs commands. Introduces application-level concurrency and Unix process control.

### Malloc Lab
Custom implementation of memory allocation functions (malloc, free, realloc), providing understanding of data layout, organization, and the trade-offs between space and time efficiency.

### Proxy Lab
Development of a concurrent caching web proxy that sits between browser and web. Covers network programming concepts including byte ordering, caching, process control, signals, file I/O, concurrency, and synchronization.
